# Industrial Process Layout Simulator

This project is an educational simulator that demonstrates simplified process control concepts using a configurable layout and real time PID controllers.

## Features
* YAML-driven configuration for layout and process models
* First-order and second-order process models
* Configurable PID controllers with optional live tuning
* PyQt dashboard with graphs and a control panel
  * adjust setpoint and PID gains at runtime
  * switch between P/PI/PID modes
  * start or pause the simulation loop
* Interactive layout editor to create new dashboards
* Signal injection and alarm monitoring for each process
* Basic stability analysis utilities

This repository provides a minimal reference implementation. It is not a fully polished industrial system, but a starting point for experimentation.
